      "Snakes are elongated, legless reptiles belonging to the suborder Serpentes. They are part of the class Reptilia and are characterized by their unique body structure, which includes a long, flexible body, a lack of limbs, and a highly mobile jaw that allows them to consume prey much larger than their head. Snakes are found in a variety of habitats, including forests, deserts, grasslands, and aquatic environments, and they are distributed across every continent except Antarctica.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key features of snakes include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Body Structure**: Snakes have a cylindrical body covered in scales, which can vary in texture and color. Their lack of limbs is a defining characteristic, and they move by contracting their muscles and using their scales to grip surfaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Diet**: Most snakes are carnivorous, feeding on a diet that can include rodents, birds, amphibians, fish, and even other reptiles. Some species are specialized feeders, while others are more generalist.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Locomotion**: Snakes move using various methods, including lateral undulation, rectilinear movement, sidewinding, and concertina movement, depending on their environment and the surface they are on.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Sensory Adaptations**: Snakes have a keen sense of smell, which they enhance by using their forked tongues to collect scent particles from the air. Many species also have specialized heat-sensing pits that allow them to detect warm-blooded prey.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Reproduction**: Snakes can be oviparous (laying eggs), viviparous (giving birth to live young), or ovoviviparous (producing eggs that hatch inside the body). The reproductive strategy varies among species.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Venom**: Some snakes possess venom, which they use to subdue prey and for defense. Venomous snakes have specialized fangs that allow them to inject venom into their prey. Notable examples include cobras, vipers, and rattlesnakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Ecological Role**: Snakes play important roles in ecosystems as both predators and prey. They help control populations of rodents and other small animals, and they are also a food source for larger predators.\n",
