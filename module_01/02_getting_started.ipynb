    "### Limitations\n",
    "One key limitation of traditional pretrained embedding representations such as Word2Vec is the problem of word sense and removing ambiguity by making them clear. While pretrained embeddings can capture some of the meaning of words in context, every possible meaning of a word is encoded into the same embedding. This can cause problems in downstream models, since many words such as the word 'play' have different meanings depending on the context they are used in.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the word 'play' in these two different sentences have quite different meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I went to a **play** at the theatre.\n",
    "- John wants to **play** with his friends.\n",
    "The pretrained embeddings above represent both meanings of the word 'play' in the same embedding. To overcome this limitation, we need to build embeddings based on the language model, which is trained on a large corpus of text, and knows how words can be put together in different contexts."
